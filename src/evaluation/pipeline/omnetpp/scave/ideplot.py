"""
This module is the interface for displaying plots using the IDE's native
(non-Matplotlib) plotting widgets from chart scripts. The API is intentionally
very close to `matplotlib.pyplot`: most functions and the parameters they accept
are a subset of `pyplot`'s interface. If one restricts themselves to a subset of
Matplotlib's functionality, switching between `omnetpp.scave.ideplot` and
`matplotlib.pyplot` in a chart script may be as simple as much as editing the
`import` statement.

When the API is used outside the context of a native plotting widget (such as
during the run of `opp_charttool`, or in IDE during image export), the functions
are emulated with Matplotlib.

Note that this module is stateful. It is set up appropriately by the OMNeT++ IDE
or `opp_charttool` before the chart script is run.

    Make a bar plot. This function adds one series to the bar plot; make

    The bars are positioned at x with the given alignment. Their dimensions

    Each of x, height, width, and bottom may either be a scalar applying to
    all bars, or it may be a sequence of length N providing a separate value
    for each bar.

    Parameters:

    - `x` (sequence of scalars): The x coordinates of the bars.
    - `height` (scalar or sequence of scalars): The height(s) of the bars.
    - `width` (scalar or array-like): The width(s) of the bars.
    - `key` (string): Identifies the series in the native plot widget.
    - `label` (string): The label of the series the bars represent .
    - `color` (string): The fill color of the bars.
    - `edgecolor` (string): The edge color of the bars.

    The native plot implementation has the following restrictions:

    - widths are automatic (parameter is ignored)
    - x coordinates are automatic (values are ignored)
    - height must be a sequence (cannot be a scalar)
    - in multiple calls to bar(), the lengths of the height sequence must be
      equal (i.e. all series must have the same number of values)
